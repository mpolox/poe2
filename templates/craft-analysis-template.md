## Profit Projection

### Conservative Estimate (60% of expected value)
- Expected value with target mods: [X] c
- Projected selling price: [X × 0.6] = [Y] c
- Total cost: [Z] c
- **Profit: [Y - Z] c**
- Break-even: [Z] c

### Moderate Estimate (80% of expected value)
- Expected value: [X] c
- Projected selling price: [X × 0.8] = [Y] c
- Total cost: [Z] c
- **Profit: [Y - Z] c**
- Margin: [(Y-Z)/Y × 100]%

### Optimistic Estimate (100% of expected value)
- Expected value: [X] c
- Projected selling price: [X] c
- Total cost: [Z] c
- **Profit: [X - Z] c**
- Margin: [(X-Z)/X × 100]%
